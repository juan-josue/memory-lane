Memory Lane

Memory Lane is an innovative application designed to support caregivers and enhance the emotional well-being of dementia patients through AI-driven reminiscence therapy and narrative storytelling.

Overview
Memory Lane addresses the critical shortage of care home volunteers for dementia patients by combining artificial intelligence with narrative storytelling. The app facilitates meaningful conversations, helping patients recall and share cherished memories while reducing the workload for caregivers. By generating personalized emotional narratives and AI-created images, Memory Lane strengthens the emotional connections between patients and their memories.
